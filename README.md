#  Python's EDA

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| üì≤ [Google Play Store](https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/tree/main/Uber%20Project)  | May 2023 | Python, GCP (Storage, Compute Engine, BigQuery), Mage, Looker Studio | Developed and implemented an end-to-end ETL pipeline for processinsg NYC Trip Record data. The pipeline encompassed extracting raw data, performing data transformation using Python, applying fact and dimensional data modelling techniques, orchestrating the pipeline on Mage, and ultimately creating a dashboard using Looker Studio. |
| ‚öΩÔ∏è [Premier League](https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/tree/main/Dog%20Adoption)  | Mar 2023 |Python, PostgreSQL, Jupyter Notebook | Designed, created, and deployed a custom data model for a dog adoption data set using Python and PostgreSQL on Jupyter Notebook. |
| üèçÔ∏è [MotoGP World Championships](https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/tree/main/Dog%20Adoption)  | Mar 2023 |Python, PostgreSQL, Jupyter Notebook | Designed, created, and deployed a custom data model for a dog adoption data set using Python and PostgreSQL on Jupyter Notebook. |
